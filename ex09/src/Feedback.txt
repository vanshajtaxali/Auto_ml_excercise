IT took extensive search from google to understand what openai gym is? how does env works and what are spaces of type boxes.
It wasn't that great to have an exercise to directly get started with reinforcement learning.
Overall took almost 3 days of searching and reading. Basically figuring out what TO DO's mean rather than learning something new.
