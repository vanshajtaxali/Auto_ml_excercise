Exercise 1b missing 0pt

Exercise 1a:
Instead of clipping the values for the mutation, you could have resampled again.
It looks like mutation and crossover are implemented correctly but not the optimization loop.
As you iterate over each population member you create a trial for each member. So in each iteration you already have #population_size function evaulations.
You were tasked to run DE for a given number of function evaluations (of which you have far too many) -1pt.
The plot you chose to show your DE implementation works is quite confusing. I'm not exactly sure what your X-axis is supposed to show.

Feedback:
Thank you for your feedback. Next time please be more specific such that we know what took you one day and why. This really helps us improve exercises.
