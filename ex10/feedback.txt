1. SMAC is not a SAT solver. It is an optimization tool that uses Bayesian optimization to find the best (hyper-)parameters
for a given target function/algorithm.

2. For me it looks like you used an older version of SMAC with a newer version of the pyrfr or vica versa when the error happened.

The scenario, the training and test split, and the running of SMAC seems to be all correctly done.
However you did not use SMACs validation script to evaluate the final incumbent and the defualt configuration on the test set.
The data you present seems to be on the (incomplete) Training data.
