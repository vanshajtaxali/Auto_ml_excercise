Comments:
In principle your solution contains all necessary answers and I see that you understood the question, but I also noticed that you copied some answers word for word from your references. In future exercises, we will deduct points for that.

Some of the statements you made, require some clarification, e.g.
 * "n_estimators": to estimate how many maximum number of estimators to be used --> "n_estimators" is the number of trees trained by AdaBoots
 * AdaBoost is very prone to overfitting, so training as many trees is not always the best solution.
 * "Could be linear, nonlinear or polynomial." - A polynomial kernel is a non-linear kernel
