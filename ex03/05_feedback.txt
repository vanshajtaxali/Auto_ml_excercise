Group: 05
Exercise: 03
Total: 3.5/4 points (rounded to your advantage)

Comments: 

(a) Well done. 1P.
(b) Well done. 0.5P.
(c) It depends on what you want to show with a plot. I would disagree that violin plots are more informative in general. Nevertheless, your answer is fine. 0.5P.
(d) H_0 and H_1 are correct. You did not discuss whether with your chosen alpha value you would reject H_0 or what conclusions you can draw from the results of the test. Furthermore, you implemented a single-sided non-paired permutation test instead of a paired test. 0.25P

Feedback: Thanks. 1P.

Minor remarks:
 - Next time, please add all answer to the pdf



-------------------------
As some of asked during the exercise session, here is example code for a paired permutation test: 

# Paired Permutation test
print("H_0: A and B have equal means")
print("H_1: The mean of A is better (smaller) than that of B")

t = np.mean(y1) - np.mean(y2)
print("Test statistic t: %f" % t)
rng = np.random.RandomState(1)
s = []
for i in range(10000):
    ind_dataset1 = []
    ind_dataset2 = []
    for i,j in zip(y1, y2):
        if rng.random_sample() > 0.5:
            ind_dataset1.append(i)
            ind_dataset2.append(j)
        else:
            ind_dataset1.append(j)
            ind_dataset2.append(i)
    m1 = np.mean(ind_dataset1)
    m2 = np.mean(ind_dataset2)
    s.append(m1-m2)
s = np.array(s)

print("Samples with s<t: %d (of %d)" % (np.sum(s<t), len(s)))
p = np.sum(s<t)/len(s)
print("Then, p-value %f < alpha?" % p)
